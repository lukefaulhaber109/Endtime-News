                [Image: The twin brothers at opposite ends of the Phoenix King's hall]
            
            </div>

            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #2c1810; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-weight: 500;">LOTHERN, ULTHUAN - The legendary twin princes of Ulthuan, Tyrion and Teclis, have once again demonstrated their mastery of passive-aggressive silence during last night's state banquet at the Phoenix King's palace, sources close to the situation confirm.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The evening, which was meant to celebrate recent victories against Dark Elf raiders, instead became what courtiers are calling "the most uncomfortable dinner since Malekith's last visit to Nagarythe."</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Tyrion, the Defender of Ulthuan and widely considered the greatest living warrior among the Asur, spent the entire evening seated at the far end of the hall discussing military strategy with Prince Imrik of Caledor. Meanwhile, his twin brother Teclis, Loremaster of Hoeth and arguably the most powerful mage in the Old World, remained conspicuously engaged in conversation with Alarielle the Everqueen at the opposite end.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">"They didn't make eye contact once," reported Lady Eldyra of Saphery, who was seated with a perfect view of both brothers. "Not even during the toast to their shared victories. Tyrion looked at his wine goblet. Teclis studied the ceiling frescoes. It was painful to watch."</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; color: #2c1810; border-left: 4px solid #8b4513; padding-left: 1rem;">A History of Fraternal Tension</h2>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The relationship between the twin sons of Prince Arathion has always been complex. Born under the dark moon, the brothers could not be more different despite sharing the same blood. Tyrion inherited the strength and martial prowess of their ancestor Aenarion, becoming a warrior without peer who rides the ancient dragon Malhandir and wields the sacred blade Sunfang.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Teclis, by contrast, was born frail and sickly, unable to match his brother's physical gifts. Instead, he developed an intellect and magical ability that surpasses even the greatest Loremaster of the White Tower. He now serves as the foremost magical advisor to the Phoenix King, carrying the legendary Moon Staff of Lileath.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">"They're basically polar opposites," explained Belannaer the Wise, a senior mage of the White Tower. "Tyrion is all muscle and instinct - charges into battle without a second thought. Teclis plans everything seventeen steps ahead and probably has a contingency spell prepared for his contingency spell. They're both right in their own way, which makes it worse."</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; color: #2c1810; border-left: 4px solid #8b4513; padding-left: 1rem;">The Sword of Khaine Incident</h2>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Those close to the brothers suggest the latest cold shoulder stems from an ongoing disagreement about Tyrion's increasing fascination with the Widowmaker, the cursed Sword of Khaine that lies in the Shrine of Khaine on the Blighted Isle.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">"Teclis has been very vocal about his concerns," said an anonymous source within the Phoenix Court. "He keeps sending Tyrion these very long, very detailed scrolls about why drawing the Sword of Khaine would be 'catastrophically unwise' and 'historically proven to doom everyone who touches it.' Tyrion hasn't read a single one. He just adds them to a pile."</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">When asked for comment, Tyrion stated simply, "My brother worries too much. I can handle a sword."</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Teclis responded through a written statement spanning fourteen pages, which can be summarized as "No, he absolutely cannot."</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; color: #2c1810; border-left: 4px solid #8b4513; padding-left: 1rem;">The Everqueen Factor</h2>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Complicating matters further is Tyrion's relationship with Alarielle the Everqueen, the living embodiment of Isha and spiritual leader of Ulthuan. The champion and the Everqueen have grown increasingly close, a fact that has not escaped Teclis's notice.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">"Teclis thinks Tyrion is being reckless with his personal life too," explained Lady Eldyra. "But he won't say it directly because that would require them to have an actual conversation, which they're both too stubborn to initiate."</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The Everqueen herself has attempted to mediate, inviting both brothers to walk in the gardens of Avelorn together. Both found pressing military and magical emergencies that required their immediate attention in opposite directions.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; color: #2c1810; border-left: 4px solid #8b4513; padding-left: 1rem;">Court Reactions</h2>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The ongoing fraternal cold war has become a source of awkward entertainment for the Phoenix Court. Nobles report having to carefully plan seating arrangements, military briefings, and even battlefield deployments to ensure the brothers don't have to interact.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">"It's exhausting," admitted Prince Althran of Eataine. "Last week we had to hold two separate war councils - one at dawn for Tyrion, one at dusk for Teclis. They both presented identical strategies but refused to attend the same meeting. We're fighting the same war twice now."</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The Phoenix King Finubar has reportedly tried to intervene multiple times, but both brothers assure him everything is "fine" while obviously seething with unspoken grievances.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">"They're literally saving Ulthuan together but can't share a dinner table," observed one exasperated courtier. "It's the most High Elf thing I've ever seen."</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; color: #2c1810; border-left: 4px solid #8b4513; padding-left: 1rem;">What's Next?</h2>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Palace insiders suggest the situation may come to a head during the upcoming Council of Princes, where both brothers are expected to present competing visions for defending Ulthuan against the growing Chaos threat.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">"Tyrion will want to march out and hit things with his sword," predicted Belannaer. "Teclis will propose a complex magical solution involving ley lines, ancient rituals, and probably some math. They're both probably right. They're both definitely too proud to admit the other has a point."</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">When pressed for final comments, Tyrion stated, "I have no brother issues. My relationship with Teclis is fine."</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Teclis, reached via magical sending stone, replied: "Define 'fine.'"</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">At press time, both brothers were spotted accidentally walking into the same hallway, immediately turning around, and leaving through different doors.</p>

                <p style="font-style: italic; margin: 0; color: #666;"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> A family therapy session has been proposed by the White Tower's Department of Emotional Well-being, but both princes have declined, citing "scheduling conflicts" that will apparently last for the next several centuries.</p>
